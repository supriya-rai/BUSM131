    "# BUSM131 Computer Lab Session 1\n",
    "## Introduction to Python Programming Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the computer lab [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming tutorial part 1. In this session, we will introduce the basics of programming with Python, in which we will look at variable assignments and different data types (numerical, text, list, and tuples). \n",
    "\n",
    "The first set of computer lab tutorials on Python programming follows the structure and organisation of McKinney, W. 2017. Python for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition, O'Reilly, but there are many equally good online resources. The computer lab tutorials are complementary to the Datacamp courses. There will be some overlaps between the computer lab material and Datacamp tutorials in the first 3-4 weeks, as this will help consolidate your learning, especially if you are new to Python. More advanced material on web scraping, machine learning, and deep learning with Python will follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install Python and Jupyter Notebook on Your Personal Computers\n",
    "\n",
    "Install Python and Jupyter Notebook by downloading the most recent stable version of the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) distribution, which can be downloaded from the provided link. Different interpreters and development environments can be used with Python. We will use the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/), which is a web browser based application that allows you to run and to insert text, equations, and graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, you can open a Jupyter notebook into which you can write code and execute. Follow the steps on [Jupyter Notebook website](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html) for operating system specific instructions, which involves running `jupyter notebook` in a terminal. You can `rename` and `save` notebooks from the `File` menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Markdown and Code Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "You can insert **code** and **markdown** cells into Jupyter notebooks. Code cells are for typing and running Python code. Markdown cells are for the text content and they serve a similar function to *HTML* to organize and format documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can add section titles by `#`, `##`, `###`, you can create numbered and bullet lists by starting the line with the corresponding marker, e.g. `1.`,`2.`, `3.`. You can format text for instance by `*italic_text*` and `**bold_text**`. Visit [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for further details.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can change the cell type from the drop-down menu at the top or choose the cell and press the keys <kbd>y</kbd> and <kbd>m</kbd> for the code and the markdown cells, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, meaning that you can freely execute different segments of code (which are cells on Jupyter notebooks) without the need to compile it first to the machine code. This reduces the development time and facilitates experimentation with data in an interactive way but slows down execution time, especially for computationally intensive tasks. This is why most heavy computations are implemented in other languages C and C++, which you access through a Python API, which is distributed as a Python package. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you click on *Run* or hit <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>  or <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> shortcuts, it runs the selected cell (more options under *Cell*).  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall now start using Python as a simple calculator. You can use the operators `+` (add), `-` (substract), `*` (multiply), `/` (divide), `**` (power), `%` (modulus) in *expressions*. For instance:"
